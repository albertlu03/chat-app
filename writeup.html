        <h1>Writeup and Design Decisions</h1>

        In my chat app, I made the design decisions for group chats to be user created, as we did in studio. Therefore the channel is created randomly (no changes here). 
        I've decided on the functionality where users can invite other users to the group chat, and any user can leave a group chat as well. Therefore I've created several schemas, such as
        the memberSchema, inviteSchema and leaveSchema, which I will use in the actual implementation of the group chat member managing system later.

        In addition, I added a core functionality related to my prototypes from hw8 and hw9. This is the scheduling feature, where users can schedule messages in advance to be sent. 
        There is a requirement that the message that a person is scheduling is at least 5 minutes out from the current time - otherwise there wouldn't be much point to scheduling the message.
        I also added very basic CSS to the website. With respect to the usability goals, mistakes can be edited easily and deleted. In addition the names make sense for interactions make 
        sense and are understandable. The interface feels fairly consistent with other chat apps I've used as well.
